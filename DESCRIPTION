Title: Sparse Generalized Factor Models with Multiple Penalty Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Zhijing", "Wang", email = "wangzhijing@sjtu.edu.cn", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements sparse generalized factor models (sparseGFM) for dimension reduction 
    and variable selection in high-dimensional data with automatic adaptation to weak factor 
    scenarios. The package supports multiple data types (continuous, count, binary) through 
    generalized linear model frameworks and handles missing values automatically. It provides 
    12 different penalty functions including Lasso, adaptive Lasso, SCAD, MCP, group Lasso, 
    and their adaptive versions for inducing row-wise sparsity in factor loadings. Key features 
    include cross-validation for regularization parameter selection using Sparsity Information 
    Criteria (SIC), automatic determination of the number of factors via multiple information 
    criteria, and specialized algorithms for row-sparse loading structures. The methodology 
    employs alternating minimization with SVD-based identifiability constraints and is 
    particularly effective for high-dimensional applications in genomics, economics, and 
    social sciences where interpretable sparse dimension reduction is crucial.
