Title: Sparse Generalized Factor Models with Multiple Penalty Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zhijing Wang
Maintainer: Zhijing Wang <wangzhijing@sjtu.edu.cn>
Description: Implements sparse generalized factor models (sparseGFM) for dimension reduction 
    and variable selection in high-dimensional data. The package supports multiple data types 
    including continuous, count, and binary data through appropriate generalized linear model 
    frameworks. It provides a comprehensive suite of penalty functions including Lasso, 
    adaptive Lasso, SCAD, MCP, and their group versions for inducing sparsity in factor 
    loadings. The package includes automatic selection procedures for both the regularization 
    parameter (via cross-validation with SIC) and the number of latent factors (via information 
    criteria). This methodology is particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data in 
    genomics, economics, and social sciences where interpretable dimension reduction is crucial.
